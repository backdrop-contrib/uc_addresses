Ubercart Addresses 6.x-2.x-dev, 2011-11-25
------------------------------
- by MegaChriz: removed unused functions uc_addresses_get_field_handlers()
  and uc_addresses_compare().
- by MegaChriz: replaced property '#required' in the uc_addresses_address
  form element with '#uc_addresses_required'. Setting this to FALSE makes

  '#uc_addresses_address' for the uc_addresses_address form element is moved

  form.
